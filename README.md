# Sierpinski Triangle

_Note: This is my first touch and project with python_ :satisfied:

> The Sierpiński triangle (sometimes spelled Sierpinski), also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a
> fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller
> equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets—that
> is, it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after
> the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of
> Sierpiński.
